But each time, just as she was about to step into the unknown, something would startle her back to the safety of the familiar. One time, a sudden flash of lightning illuminated the sky with a deafening clap of thunder. Another time, a strange, eerie howling sound echoed from the nearby woods. Once, a sharp thorn pricked her paw, making her yowl in pain and retreat."

            "text": "The other young cats of the court, whom Rue secretly called the \"Kittie-sans,\" began to notice her repeated attempts and hasty retreats. They started to tease her, their playful meows turning into mocking whispers. \"Look, it's Princess Run-Away!\" one would hiss. \"Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat!\" another would chime in. Rue's heart grew heavy with sadness, and tears would often well up in her emerald eyes."

She puffed out her chest, her whiskers twitching with determination. \"No more!\" she declared to herself. \"I will not let silly fears hold me back any longer!\" She marched to the royal armory and, with the help of a friendly squirrel, donned a shiny coat of miniature armor and a gleaming helmet. Feeling brave and resolute, Princess Rue finally stepped beyond the palace walls."

But as the sun began to dip below the horizon, the sky grew dark, and a gentle rain started to fall. Soon, the gentle rain turned into a downpour, and the forest became shadowy and spooky. \"Oh no,\" Rue whimpered. To make matters worse, her armor felt heavy and stiff, and her helmet blocked her usually excellent Kitty Kat Night Vision."

Princess Rue wasn't sure if she should be even more worried, but she found a last ounce of bravery and stood up tall, her little armored shoulders squared. Coincidentally, as she stood, her knight's helmet snagged on a low-hanging tree branch and finally came off, freeing her vision."

And then, out of the woods fluttered Princess Aafiya, soon to be Queen of the Fairies! Fairy Princess Aafiya had been searching all over the woods for a best friend to stand by her side when she received her Queen's Crown at the grand Fairy Ball."
