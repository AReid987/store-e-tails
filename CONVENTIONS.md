# devLog XPRT Conventions

## Overview
    
- This Conventions file provides a set of guidelines and best practices for the devLog XPRT project.

## Purpose

### These conventions ensure that 

  - There is a clear and consistent approach to 
    - coding
    - documentation
    - project structure.
  - There is a single source of truth for which package management tools to use.
  - All parts of the project are documented
  - All code is linted and formatted
  - All code is tested

## Use Cases

- These conventions are ideal for the following use cases:
  - Coding
  - Documentation
  - Testing

## Usage

### JavaScript, Typescript, & Node.js

- DO NOT use 
  - `npm`
  - `yarn`
- ALWAYS use
  - `pnpm`

### Python

- DO NOT use
  - `pip`
  - `poetry`
  - `venv`
  - `pipenv`
  - `conda`
  - `virtualenv`
  - `pyenv`
- ALWAYS use
  - `pdm`
  - `uv`
  - For example `pdm list`
- Add a python package to the `pyproject.toml` file with `pdm add <package-name>`
- Python packages and apps are created with the commands:
  - `pdm init` 
  - `source .venv/bin/activate`

### Turborepo

- This is a monorepo managed by [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).
- Turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.
- Turborepo uses [turbo](https://turbo.build/) for task management.
- When possible and appropriate add task commands to the `turbo.json` file.

#### Apps & Packages

- Standalone code is created as an app in the `apps` directory.
- Shared code is created as a package in the `packages` directory.
- Apps and packages have a package.json file.
  - Create a package.json file for each app and package with `pnpm init`.
  - The package.json file should have the field `"name"` set to the name of the app or package with `@devlog-xprt/` prefix.
  - The package.json file should have the field `"version"` set to "0.0.0".
- Apps and packages have a README.md file.
  - The README.md file should 
    - give a high level overview of the app or package. 
    - include installation instructions, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.

## Coding

- Before writing any code, first write a plan.
- After writing a plan, break the plan into smaller tasks.
- For each task, first write a test.
- After writing a test, write the code.
- After writing the code, run the test.
- After running the test, fix any errors.
- After fixing any errors, run the test again.
- Continue running the test and fixing any errors until the test passes.
- When the test passes, commit the code.
- Repeat the process for each task.
